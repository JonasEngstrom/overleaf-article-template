# Overleaf Article Template

This is a template for an RStudio project using R Markdown to generate LaTeX files for synchronization with Overleaf. It is meant to minimize setup time when starting new scientific papers.

I used a method similar to the one used by this template for syncing locally to Overleaf, when writing the first paper meant for inclusion in my PhD thesis. My hope is that this template will simplify setup of the following articles during my PhD studies.

My ambition is to keep adding automation scripts and documentation—both related to the template itself and to the writing process as a whole—in [the wiki associated with this GitHub repo](https://github.com/JonasEngstrom/overleaf-article-template/wiki).

Since the project is meant as a template, the readme and license files will likely be changed in projects based on the template. Documentation is therefore kept in the wiki to allow it to be accessed and updated independently of any instances created from the template.
