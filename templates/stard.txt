## Abstract

<!-- Identification as a study of diagnostic accuracy using at least one measure of accuracy (such as sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, or AUC) -->

### Background and Objectives

<!-- Study objectives -->

### Methods

<!-- Data collection: whether this was a prospective or retrospective study -->

<!-- Eligibility criteria for participants and settings where the data were collected -->

<!-- Whether participants formed a consecutive, random, or convenience series -->

<!-- Description of the index test and reference standard -->

### Results

<!-- Number of participants with and without the target condition included in the analysis -->

<!-- Estimates of diagnostic accuracy and their precision (such as 95% confidence intervals) -->

### Discussion

<!-- General interpretation of the results -->

<!-- Implications for practice, including the intended use of the index test -->

### Registration

<!-- Registration number and name of registry -->

## Introduction

<!-- Scientific and clinical background, including the intended use and clinical role of the index test -->

<!-- Study objectives and hypotheses -->

## Methods

### Study design

<!-- Whether data collection was planned before the index test and reference standard were performed (prospective study) or after (retrospective study) -->

### Participants

<!-- Eligibility criteria -->

<!-- On what basis potentially eligible participants were identified (such as symptoms, results from previous tests, inclusion in registry) -->

<!-- Where and when potentially eligible participants were identified (setting, location and dates) -->

<!-- Whether participants formed a consecutive, random or convenience series -->

### Test methods

<!-- Index test, in sufficient detail to allow replication -->

<!-- Reference standard, in sufficient detail to allow replication -->

<!-- Rationale for choosing the reference standard (if alternatives exist) -->

<!-- Definition of and rationale for test positivity cut-offs or result categories of the index test, distinguishing pre-specified from exploratory -->

<!-- Definition of and rationale for test positivity cut-offs or result categories of the reference standard, distinguishing pre-specified from exploratory -->

<!-- Whether clinical information and reference standard results were available to the performers/readers of the index test -->

<!-- Whether clinical information and index test results were available to the assessors of the reference standard -->

### Analysis

<!-- Methods for estimating or comparing measures of diagnostic accuracy -->

<!-- How indeterminate index test or reference standard results were handled -->

<!-- How missing data on the index test and reference standard were handled -->

<!-- Any analyses of variability in diagnostic accuracy, distinguishing pre-specified from exploratory -->

<!-- Intended sample size and how it was determined -->

## Results

### Participants

<!-- Flow of participants, using a diagram -->

<!-- Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of participants -->

<!-- Distribution of severity of disease in those with the target condition -->

<!-- Distribution of alternative diagnoses in those without the target condition -->

<!-- Time interval and any clinical interventions between index test and reference standard -->

### Test results

<!-- Cross tabulation of the index test results (or their distribution) by the results of the reference standard -->

<!-- Estimates of diagnostic accuracy and their precision (such as 95% confidence intervals) -->

<!-- Any adverse events from performing the index test or the reference standard -->

## Discussion

<!-- Study limitations, including sources of potential bias, statistical uncertainty, and generalisability -->

<!-- Implications for practice, including the intended use and clinical role of the index test -->
