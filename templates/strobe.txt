## Title and abstract

<!-- Indicate the study’s design with a commonly used term in the title or the abstract -->

<!-- Provide in the abstract an informative and balanced summary of what was done and what was found -->

## Introduction

### Background/rationale

<!-- Explain the scientific background and rationale for the investigation being reported -->

### Objectives

<!-- State specific objectives, including any prespecified hypotheses -->

## Methods

### Study design

<!-- Present key elements of study design early in the paper -->

### Setting

<!-- Describe the setting, locations, and relevant dates, including periods of recruitment, exposure, follow-up, and data collection -->

### Participants

<!-- Cohort study—Give the eligibility criteria, and the sources and methods of selection of participants. Describe methods of follow-up -->

<!-- Case-control study—Give the eligibility criteria, and the sources and methods of case ascertainment and control selection. Give the rationale for the choice of cases and controls -->

<!-- Cross-sectional study—Give the eligibility criteria, and the sources and methods of selection of participants -->

<!-- Cohort study—For matched studies, give matching criteria and number of exposed and unexposed -->

<!-- Case-control study—For matched studies, give matching criteria and the number of controls per case -->

### Variables

<!-- Clearly define all outcomes, exposures, predictors, potential confounders, and effect modifiers. Give diagnostic criteria, if applicable -->

### Data sources/ measurement

<!-- For each variable of interest, give sources of data and details of methods of assessment (measurement). Describe comparability of assessment methods if there is more than one group -->

### Bias

<!-- Describe any efforts to address potential sources of bias -->

### Study size

<!-- Explain how the study size was arrived at -->

### Quantitative variables

<!-- Explain how quantitative variables were handled in the analyses. If applicable, describe which groupings were chosen and why -->

### Statistical methods

<!-- Describe all statistical methods, including those used to control for confounding -->

<!-- Describe any methods used to examine subgroups and interactions -->

<!-- Explain how missing data were addressed -->

<!-- Cohort study—If applicable, explain how loss to follow-up was addressed -->

<!-- Case-control study—If applicable, explain how matching of cases and controls was addressed -->

<!-- Cross-sectional study—If applicable, describe analytical methods taking account of sampling strategy -->

<!-- Describe any sensitivity analyses -->

## Results

### Participants

<!-- Report numbers of individuals at each stage of study—eg numbers potentially eligible, examined for eligibility, confirmed eligible, included in the study, completing follow-up, and analysed -->

<!-- Give reasons for non-participation at each stage -->

<!-- Consider use of a flow diagram -->

### Descriptive data

<!-- Give characteristics of study participants (eg demographic, clinical, social) and information on exposures and potential confounders -->

<!-- Indicate number of participants with missing data for each variable of interest -->

<!-- Cohort study—Summarise follow-up time (eg, average and total amount) -->

### Outcome data

<!-- Cohort study—Report numbers of outcome events or summary measures over time -->

<!-- Case-control study—Report numbers in each exposure category, or summary measures of exposure -->

<!-- Cross-sectional study—Report numbers of outcome events or summary measures -->

### Main results

<!-- Give unadjusted estimates and, if applicable, confounder-adjusted estimates and their precision (eg, 95% confidence interval). Make clear which confounders were adjusted for and why they were included -->

<!-- Report category boundaries when continuous variables were categorized -->

<!-- If relevant, consider translating estimates of relative risk into absolute risk for a meaningful time period -->

### Other analyses

<!-- Report other analyses done—eg analyses of subgroups and interactions, and sensitivity analyses -->

## Discussion

### Key results

<!-- Summarise key results with reference to study objectives -->

### Limitations

<!-- Discuss limitations of the study, taking into account sources of potential bias or imprecision. Discuss both direction and magnitude of any potential bias -->

### Interpretation

<!-- Give a cautious overall interpretation of results considering objectives, limitations, multiplicity of analyses, results from similar studies, and other relevant evidence -->

### Generalisability

<!-- Discuss the generalisability (external validity) of the study results -->

## Other information

### Funding

<!-- Give the source of funding and the role of the funders for the present study and, if applicable, for the original study on which the present article is based -->
