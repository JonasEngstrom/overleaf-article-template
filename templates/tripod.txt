## Title and abstract

### Title

<!-- Identify the study as developing and/or validating a multivariable prediction model, the target population, and the outcome to be predicted. -->

### Abstract

<!-- Provide a summary of objectives, study design, setting, participants, sample size, predictors, outcome, statistical analysis, results, and conclusions. -->

## Introduction

### Background and objectives

<!-- Explain the medical context (including whether diagnostic or prognostic) and rationale for developing or validating the multivariable prediction model, including references to existing models. -->

<!-- Specify the objectives, including whether the study describes the development or validation of the model or both. -->

## Methods

### Source of data

<!-- Describe the study design or source of data (e.g., randomized trial, cohort, or registry data), separately for the development and validation data sets, if applicable. -->

<!-- Specify the key study dates, including start of accrual; end of accrual; and, if applicable, end of follow-up. -->

### Participants

<!-- Specify key elements of the study setting (e.g., primary care, secondary care, general population) including number and location of centres. -->

<!-- Describe eligibility criteria for participants. -->

<!-- Give details of treatments received, if relevant. -->

### Outcome

<!-- Clearly define the outcome that is predicted by the prediction model, including how and when assessed. -->

<!-- Report any actions to blind assessment of the outcome to be predicted. -->

### Predictors

<!-- Clearly define all predictors used in developing or validating the multivariable prediction model, including how and when they were measured. -->

<!-- Report any actions to blind assessment of predictors for the outcome and other predictors. -->

### Sample size

<!-- Explain how the study size was arrived at. -->

### Missing data

<!-- Describe how missing data were handled (e.g., complete-case analysis, single imputation, multiple imputation) with details of any imputation method. -->

### Statistical analysis methods

<!-- (Development studies) Describe how predictors were handled in the analyses. -->

<!-- (Development studies) Specify type of model, all model-building procedures (including any predictor selection), and method for internal validation. -->

<!-- (Validation studies) For validation, describe how the predictions were calculated. -->

<!-- Specify all measures used to assess model performance and, if relevant, to compare multiple models. -->

<!-- (Validation studies) Describe any model updating (e.g., recalibration) arising from the validation, if done. -->

### Risk groups

<!-- Provide details on how risk groups were created, if done. -->

### Development vs. validation

<!-- (Validation studies) For validation, identify any differences from the development data in setting, eligibility criteria, outcome, and predictors. -->

## Results

### Participants

<!-- Describe the flow of participants through the study, including the number of participants with and without the outcome and, if applicable, a summary of the follow-up time. A diagram may be helpful. -->

<!-- Describe the characteristics of the participants (basic demographics, clinical features, available predictors), including the number of participants with missing data for predictors and outcome. -->

<!-- (Validation studies) For validation, show a comparison with the development data of the distribution of important variables (demographics, predictors and outcome). -->

### Model development

<!-- (Development studies) Specify the number of participants and outcome events in each analysis. -->

<!-- (Development studies) If done, report the unadjusted association between each candidate predictor and outcome. -->

### Model specification

<!-- (Development studies) Present the full prediction model to allow predictions for individuals (i.e., all regression coefficients, and model intercept or baseline survival at a given time point). -->

<!-- (Development studies) Explain how to the use the prediction model. -->

### Model performance

<!-- Report performance measures (with CIs) for the prediction model. -->

### Model-updating

<!-- (Validation studies) If done, report the results from any model updating (i.e., model specification, model performance). -->

## Discussion

### Limitations

<!-- Discuss any limitations of the study (such as nonrepresentative sample, few events per predictor, missing data). -->

### Interpretation

<!-- (Validation studies) For validation, discuss the results with reference to performance in the development data, and any other validation data. -->

<!-- Give an overall interpretation of the results, considering objectives, limitations, results from similar studies, and other relevant evidence. -->

### Implications

<!-- Discuss the potential clinical use of the model and implications for future research. -->

## Other information

### Supplementary information

<!-- Provide information about the availability of supplementary resources, such as study protocol, Web calculator, and data sets. -->

### Funding

<!-- Give the source of funding and the role of the funders for the present study. -->
